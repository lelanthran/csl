1. Parser is ignoring the final token in a file. This is an error in the
   reader.

-- 2. rt_new() currently loads each builtin individually. Must change to
-- load everything in a loop (store the string/function pairs in an
-- array).

-- 3. Must perform replacement in rt_add_symbol.

-- 4. (Linked to #3) provide an undefine that removes entries from the symbol
--    table.

-- 5. Add support for user-defined functions. This is harder than it looks;
--    will need to decide on scoping rules (prefer dynamic - it's easier to
--    implement) and ensure that every "list" node can also store a symbol
--    table. This means, of course, that the rt_symbol_* functions must
--    operate on a given symbol table, and not the global one.
--
--    (NOTE: Have to implement a stack, because adding symbol tables to
--    atom_LIST types result in each atom needing a pointer to its parent as
--    well. The stack can be almost fully implemented in rt_t data objects)
