\begin{abstract}
\emph{CSL} (\emph{C Scripting Language}) is a simple macro language meant
to facilitate easy integration with the \emph{C} programming language. As
of writing this implementation is still incomplete, and this warning will
be replaced with a different notice once the language is considered
complete enough to use.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Every element in \CSL{} is either an \verb+atom+ or an expression.
